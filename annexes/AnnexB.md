# Annex B: Governance and Oversight

This annex outlines the governance framework and oversight mechanisms for implementing the Robot Ethical Constitution.

1. **Oversight Committee**: A designated body, such as Loopmindsâ€™ Ethics Council, tasked with monitoring compliance, approving amendments, and reviewing ethical concerns.
2. **Ethics Board Structure**:
   - Chairperson: Responsible for overall governance and reporting.
   - Technical Advisor: Ensures systems meet safety and operational standards.
