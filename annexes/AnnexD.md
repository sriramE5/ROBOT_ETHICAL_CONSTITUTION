# Annex D: Amendment Procedure

D.1 **Proposal of Amendments**: Any member of the robotics community, including Council members, researchers, or industry stakeholders, may propose amendments to this Constitution. Proposals should be submitted in writing to the Robot Ethics Council for initial review.

D.2 **Review and Approval**: Proposed amendments will be discussed by the Council and may be opened for public comment. An amendment must receive approval from a qualified majority of the Council (for example, two-thirds) before adoption.

D.3 **Publication**: Once approved, amendments are incorporated into the official document. The updated version of the Constitution (with a revision history) is then published in the repository. All robots and stakeholders are expected to comply with the new provisions by a specified effective date.
