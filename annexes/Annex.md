# Annex A: Definitions

A.1 **Robot**: An autonomous machine or artificial agent capable of sensing its environment, processing information, and taking actions accordingly. Robots may include physical embodiments (such as humanoid robots, drones, or industrial machines) as well as virtual or embodied software agents.

A.2 **Artificial Intelligence**: The computational processes by which a robot perceives its environment, learns from data, and makes decisions. This includes methods such as machine learning, reasoning, perception, and natural language processing.

A.3 **Autonomy**: The degree to which a robot can perform tasks and make decisions independently, without direct human intervention. Higher autonomy means the robot requires less oversight to achieve its objectives in a given context.

A.4 **Human Being**: Any natural person, recognizing inherent dignity and legal rights. This term includes all individuals irrespective of nationality, ethnicity, or status.

A.5 **Human Authority**: Individuals or institutions legally empowered to command or direct a robot’s actions (e.g., owners, operators, supervisors, or designated officials).

A.6 **Constitution**: This Robot Ethical Constitution, including all its Articles and Annexes.

A.7 **Violation**: Any action or decision by a robot that contravenes the provisions of this Constitution or applicable laws and ethical norms.
# Annex B: Governance and Oversight

B.1 **Robot Ethics Council**: A body of experts and stakeholders (the "Council") established to interpret and oversee this Constitution. The Council reviews proposed amendments, issues guidance on ethical principles, and mediates disputes related to robot behavior.

B.2 **Implementation Responsibility**: Manufacturers, developers, and operators of robots are responsible for embedding the Constitution’s principles into design and operation. Organizations shall document compliance measures and conduct regular audits to ensure adherence to this Constitution.

B.3 **Reporting and Enforcement**: Suspected violations of the Constitution may be reported to the Council or appropriate authorities. The Council, in collaboration with regulators, may recommend enforcement actions or corrective measures when robots or their creators fail to comply with these standards.
# Annex C: Implementation Guidelines

C.1 **Technical Integration**: The principles of this Constitution may be implemented in software and hardware through technical means (e.g., rule-based systems, priority-driven control, or ethical inference engines). Developers should ensure the Constitution is enforced at the highest level of decision-making within the robot.

C.2 **Documentation Standards**: All robots should include accessible documentation of how the constitutional principles are integrated. This includes versioned descriptions of ethical modules, audit logs, and compliance certifications where applicable.

C.3 **Metadata and References**: The file `config.yaml` (or equivalent) may be used to store metadata about the Constitution (title, version, authors, license, and relevant tags). It can also reference the Constitutional version and provide machine-readable pointers to sections, facilitating digital verification and integration with robotic systems.
# Annex D: Amendment Procedure

D.1 **Proposal of Amendments**: Any member of the robotics community, including Council members, researchers, or industry stakeholders, may propose amendments to this Constitution. Proposals should be submitted in writing to the Robot Ethics Council for initial review.

D.2 **Review and Approval**: Proposed amendments will be discussed by the Council and may be opened for public comment. An amendment must receive approval from a qualified majority of the Council (for example, two-thirds) before adoption.

D.3 **Publication**: Once approved, amendments are incorporated into the official document. The updated version of the Constitution (with a revision history) is then published in the repository. All robots and stakeholders are expected to comply with the new provisions by a specified effective date.
