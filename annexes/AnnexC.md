# Annex C: Implementation Guidelines

C.1 **Technical Integration**: The principles of this Constitution may be implemented in software and hardware through technical means (e.g., rule-based systems, priority-driven control, or ethical inference engines). Developers should ensure the Constitution is enforced at the highest level of decision-making within the robot.

C.2 **Documentation Standards**: All robots should include accessible documentation of how the constitutional principles are integrated. This includes versioned descriptions of ethical modules, audit logs, and compliance certifications where applicable.

C.3 **Metadata and References**: The file `config.yaml` (or equivalent) may be used to store metadata about the Constitution (title, version, authors, license, and relevant tags). It can also reference the Constitutional version and provide machine-readable pointers to sections, facilitating digital verification and integration with robotic systems.
