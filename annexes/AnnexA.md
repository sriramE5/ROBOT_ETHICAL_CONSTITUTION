1. **Robot**: Any autonomous or semi-autonomous machine, system, or algorithm designed to perform tasks in interaction with the physical or digital environment.
2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: A system capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, including decision-making, pattern recognition, and learning.
3. **Human-in-the-loop**: A design principle where human operators are integrated into the decision-making process, allowing intervention and oversight.
4. **Data Minimization**: The practice of collecting only the data necessary to fulfill a task while avoiding excessive or unrelated data gathering.
5. **Transparency**: The ability of a system to disclose relevant information about its operation, decision-making process, and purpose in a manner understandable to users.
6. **Bias**: Systematic and unfair discrimination resulting from flawed data, algorithms, or assumptions that disproportionately affect certain groups.
7. **Lifecycle Management**: The structured approach to the design, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of robotic systems.
8. **Emergency Shutdown**: A protocol or mechanism that safely stops a robotâ€™s operation to prevent harm or mitigate risks in urgent situations.
9. **Circular Economy**: An economic model aimed at reducing waste and maximizing resource reuse throughout the lifecycle of products and services.

These definitions ensure consistency and clarity in interpretation for developers, users, and regulators engaging with the Robot Ethical Constitution.
