This repository publishes the Robot Ethical Constitution, a comprehensive set of ethical principles and guidelines for all robotic and AI systems. It is structured into Articles and Annexes (see below), and is licensed under CC BY 4.0.

Summary: The Constitution emphasizes that robots must respect human rights and dignity at all times

. It extends classic robotics principles (like Asimov’s “do no harm”
 
) with modern values such as transparency, fairness, privacy, and accountability. Key themes include non-maleficence (never harming humans)
 
, beneficence (robots serving human needs)
 
, human autonomy and control
