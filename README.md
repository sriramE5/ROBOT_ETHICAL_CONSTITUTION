# Robot Ethical Constitution

The *Robot Ethical Constitution* is a foundational set of principles to govern the ethical design, development, and operation of robotic systems. It establishes the rights, responsibilities, and core values that ensure robots act in ways that are safe, fair, and beneficial to humanity. The Constitution is organized into 13 Articles (see the `chapters/` directory) covering key ethical mandates, and 4 Annexes (in the `annexes/` directory) providing definitions, governance structure, and implementation guidelines.

## Structure

- **Articles 1–13** (`chapters/Article1.md` through `Article13.md`): Core provisions of the Constitution. Each article addresses a key aspect of robot ethics, such as human safety, privacy, fairness, and accountability.  
- **Annexes A–D** (`annexes/AnnexA.md` through `annexes/AnnexD.md`): Supplementary sections including definitions of terms, governance and oversight mechanisms, technical implementation notes, and procedures for amendment.  
- **LICENSE**: Open-source license for the Constitution text.  
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributors (how to propose amendments, submit feedback, and engage respectfully).  
- **config.yaml** (optional): Metadata and schema information for digital integration.
