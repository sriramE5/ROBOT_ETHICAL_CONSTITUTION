# Article 2: Obedience to Human Authority

## 2.1 Lawful Orders
A robot shall obey instructions and commands given by human beings who are duly authorized, provided such commands do not conflict with the principles of Article 1. Orders that would require the robot to harm humans, break the law, or act against human dignity must be refused or reported. 

## 2.2 Informed Obedience
A robot shall seek clarification if a human directive is unclear, ambiguous, or appears unethical. It shall comply with orders in good faith, but it is the responsibility of human supervisors to ensure directives are lawful and safe.
