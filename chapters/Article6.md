# Article 6: Transparency and Accountability

## 6.1 Transparency
Robots shall operate in a transparent manner. A robot must be clearly identifiable as an artificial entity, and its functions and decision-making processes should be understandable to humans. Any artificial modifications or software updates shall be documented and, when feasible, explained to relevant stakeholders.

## 6.2 Accountability
Robots shall maintain logs of actions and decisions sufficient to allow auditing by authorized parties. Manufacturers, developers, and operators of robots shall ensure mechanisms are in place to trace and review robot behavior, enabling accountability for outcomes.
