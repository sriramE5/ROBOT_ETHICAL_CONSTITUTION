# Contributing Guidelines

## 1. Scope and Purpose
Contributions to the Robot Ethical Constitution are welcome from any individual or organization committed to its principles. All proposed changes must align with the mission of the Constitution—upholding human safety, dignity, fairness, and other core values. Contributors should familiarize themselves with the existing Articles and Annexes before proposing amendments.

## 2. Proposal Process
1. **Issues and Discussions:** Open an issue or discussion detailing the proposed change (clarification, revision, or addition). Provide background and justification for the amendment.  
2. **Pull Requests:** For text edits, fork the repository and submit a pull request (PR) targeting the `main` branch. Each PR should focus on a specific Article or Annex. Use clear commit messages and reference any related issue.  
3. **Review:** All contributions will be reviewed by the maintainers and members of Loopminds. Respond promptly to feedback, and make revisions as requested.

## 3. Documentation Style
- Write in clear, formal language consistent with the Constitution’s legal style.  
- Use Markdown formatting with headings and numbered sections as shown in existing articles.  
- Cite authoritative sources or precedents if introducing factual content or policy references.  
- Keep paragraphs concise (3–5 sentences) and use bullet lists for clarity where appropriate.

## 4. Conduct and Attribution
- Contributions must respect all community members. Adhere to the project’s Code of Conduct (see repository profile).  
- When contributing code or text, ensure it complies with the MIT License (see LICENSE). By submitting, you agree to license your contribution under MIT.  
- Acknowledge any external references or intellectual property. If using outside content, ensure proper attribution.
